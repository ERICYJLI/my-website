I'm a data analytics and machine learning enthusiast based in Canada. I like
working on projects that sit at the intersection of data, products, and people.

For the past few years I've been:

- Studying data, math, and human-computer interaction at the University of Toronto  
- Building small projects with Python, SQL, and visualization tools  
- Exploring how AI can help people make better decisions in their day-to-day lives  

🧭 **On this site:**

- I’ll post notes on things I’m learning  
- Share write-ups from projects and experiments  
- Occasionally write about internships, career stuff, and side projects
