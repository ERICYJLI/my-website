Welcome to my first post on this site. I'll use this space to share short updates, notes, and experiments related to the project.

This post was created as a starter example. Edit the file at `content/posts/my-first-post/index.md` to replace this text with your own content.

Tips:

- Add images to the post by placing them in `assets/img/` and referencing them in the Markdown.
- Use categories and tags in the front matter to organize content.
- Run `hugo server -D` to preview the site locally.

Happy writing!
